# Contributing Guidelines  
## Scope, Intent, and Contribution Policy

Thank you for your interest in the **Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)**.

This repository represents a **coherent speculative framework** with explicit
ontological commitments, constraints, and non-claims. Contributions are welcome
only insofar as they respect those boundaries.

---

## Nature of This Repository

SCSM is:
- a speculative, non-empirical theoretical model,
- developed under strict internal consistency constraints,
- curated as a unified conceptual structure.

It is **not**:
- an open-ended brainstorming space,
- a collaborative wiki,
- or a platform for unconstrained speculative additions.

Maintaining coherence takes precedence over expansion.

---

## What Contributions Are Appropriate

Contributions may be considered if they:
- identify internal inconsistencies or ambiguities,
- suggest clarifications or improved phrasing,
- point out redundancy or structural issues,
- raise well-posed questions aligned with the model’s assumptions,
- propose refinements that *do not introduce new axioms*.

All contributions must engage with the existing framework as written.

---

## What Contributions Are Out of Scope

The following will generally not be accepted:
- alternative metaphysical frameworks,
- additions of new axioms or ontological primitives,
- empirical claims presented as validation or falsification,
- spiritual, religious, or ideological interpretations,
- extensions that fundamentally alter the model’s scope or commitments.

Forking the repository is encouraged for divergent approaches.

## Submission Process

If you wish to contribute:
1. Open an issue describing the proposed change or question.
2. Clearly reference the relevant document or section.
3. Explain how the suggestion fits within the existing framework.

Pull requests may be declined without prejudice if they conflict with the
model’s scope or preservation goals.

## Authorship and Authority

Final decisions regarding:
- content,
- structure,
- and inclusion

rest with the human author(s) responsible for this repository.

AI tools do not participate in contribution evaluation or governance.

---

## Closing Note

SCSM values **clarity, restraint, and coherence** over breadth or popularity.

Thoughtful critique is welcome. Unbounded expansion is not.

Thank you for engaging respectfully.
