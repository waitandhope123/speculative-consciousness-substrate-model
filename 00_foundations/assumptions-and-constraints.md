# Assumptions and Constraints  
## Foundational Commitments of SCSM

This document enumerates the **explicit assumptions** and **structural constraints** that govern the  
**Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)**. These are not claims of truth, but the minimal
commitments required for the model to function coherently.

They delimit what SCSM *can* and *cannot* say.

---

## Core Assumptions

### 1. Ontological Primacy of Consciousness
SCSM assumes that **primordial consciousness** is ontologically primary — not derived from matter,
information, or computation. This assumption is not argued for empirically; it is a starting condition.

---

### 2. Non-Spatiotemporality of the Substrate
The substrate is assumed to be:
- non-spatial
- non-temporal
- non-geometric

Spacetime arises from a state change within the substrate rather than containing it.

---

### 3. Single State Change
Only one substrate-to-spacetime state change is assumed.
No ongoing creation events, cycles, or recursive cosmologies are posited.

---

### 4. Persistence of Identity
Once individuated, identities persist and remain discrete.
Identity is not reducible to memory, personality, or embodiment state.

---

### 5. Invariant Memory
Memory associated with identity exists as invariant structure in the substrate.
Loss of access is permitted; loss of memory itself is not.

---

## Structural Constraints

### A. Domain Constraint
Established scientific domains retain authority within their scope.
SCSM does not modify physical law, neurological mechanism, or biological process.

---

### B. Non-Teleology Constraint
No purpose, goal, moral arc, optimization, or intention is attributed to:
- primordial consciousness
- the substrate
- identity
- the universe

Any teleological interpretation violates this constraint.

---

### C. Non-Empirical Constraint
SCSM does not:
- generate testable predictions,
- claim empirical validation,
- reinterpret data as proof.

Phenomenological reports act only as **constraints**, not evidence.

---

### D. Constraint-Based Reasoning
Causation is not assumed outside spacetime.
Structure is inferred from **what must be true for reports and observations to be mutually consistent**.

---

### E. Minimality Constraint
No additional entities, mechanisms, or processes are introduced unless required for internal coherence.

---

## Interpretive Constraints

### 1. Phenomenology as Limiting Input
First-person reports may constrain what is possible but cannot determine what exists.

---

### 2. Analogy Limitation
Analogies (e.g., fields, boundaries, elasticity) are descriptive tools only.
They do not imply literal physical properties unless explicitly stated.

---

### 3. Language Constraint
Terms that resemble scientific or spiritual language are used with definitions fixed by `GLOSSARY.md`.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

The following are excluded by constraint, not omission:

- quantum-mechanical explanations of consciousness
- computational or informational identity models
- moral accounting systems
- enlightenment, progress, or purpose narratives
- claims of privileged access or revelation

---

## Consequences of These Constraints

Because of these constraints:
- the model may remain incomplete indefinitely,
- some questions are intentionally left unanswered,
- and some intuitively appealing ideas are rejected.

This is a deliberate trade-off to preserve coherence.

---

## Summary

SCSM rests on a small number of strong assumptions, bounded by explicit constraints.
These constraints are not weaknesses; they define the model’s identity.

Any critique or extension of SCSM should begin by addressing these assumptions directly.
