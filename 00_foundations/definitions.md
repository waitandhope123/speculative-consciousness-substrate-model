# Definitions  
## Core Structural Definitions for SCSM

This document provides **concise, structural definitions** of foundational concepts used in the  
**Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)**.

Unlike `GLOSSARY.md`, which serves as a reference for all terms, this file defines only those concepts
that are **structurally load-bearing** for the model.

These definitions are normative within this repository.

---

## Substrate
The non-temporal, non-spatial ontological domain identified with primordial consciousness. The substrate
is ontologically primary and not governed by physical law.

---

## Primordial Consciousness
The undifferentiated ontological ground proposed by SCSM. It is not an agent, mind, or subject of
experience, and has no goals, intentions, or awareness.

---

## State Change
A single, non-recurring transition within primordial consciousness that gives rise to spacetime and
physical law. This transition does not occur *in time*; it is the origin of time.

---

## Spacetime
The domain of physical reality governed by established physical laws. Spacetime is emergent from the
substrate and does not exhaust reality.

---

## Individuation
The process by which primordial consciousness differentiates into discrete identities under
embodiment constraints. Individuation is treated as irreversible.

---

## Identity
A bounded, persistent differentiation of primordial consciousness. Identity is not reducible to
memory, personality, or embodiment, and persists beyond death.

---

## Embodiment
The coupling of an identity to spacetime through a physical organism. Embodiment imposes constraints
such as linear time, sensory localization, and memory suppression.

---

## Constraint
Any structural limitation imposed by embodiment or by the model’s axioms that shapes how consciousness
is expressed or accessed.

---

## Boundary
The interface between embodiment and the substrate. The boundary is dynamic, permeable, and rate-limited,
allowing constrained interaction between consciousness and spacetime.

---

## Boundary Permeability
The degree to which substrate interaction influences embodied experience. Normally sub-threshold,
permeability can increase under specific conditions such as sleep or near-death states.

---

## Memory
Invariant identity-associated structure existing in the substrate. Memory is not stored in spacetime and
is not subject to decay, though access is constrained during embodiment.

---

## Phenomenology
First-person experiential reports. In SCSM, phenomenology constrains ontology but does not determine it.

---

## Non-Teleology
The principle that no purpose, goal, optimization, or moral structure is attributed to the substrate,
identity, or universe.

---

## Failure Mode
A condition under which the internal coherence of SCSM would collapse, requiring revision or abandonment.

---

## Summary
These definitions establish the minimal conceptual vocabulary required to interpret SCSM coherently.
All further elaboration in the model depends on these terms remaining fixed.
