# Scope and Non-Claims  
## What SCSM Addresses — and What It Explicitly Does Not

This document defines the **intended scope** of the  
**Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)** and enumerates the **explicit non-claims** that
govern interpretation of the model.

It exists to prevent category errors, overextension, and misrepresentation.

---

## In Scope

SCSM addresses questions at the level of **ontological structure**, including:

- Whether consciousness can be coherently treated as ontologically fundamental
- How identity might persist independently of embodiment
- How memory could exist as invariant structure rather than localized storage
- How embodiment functions as a constraint regime on experience
- How phenomenological patterns (e.g., NDEs, dream states) constrain possible models
- How cosmology might be interpreted if spacetime is not ontologically primary

These questions are addressed **conceptually**, not empirically.

---

## Out of Scope by Design

The following are **explicitly out of scope**, regardless of plausibility or popularity:

### Empirical Science
- Experimental design or validation
- Testable predictions
- Physical mechanism proposals
- Neuroscientific or biological reduction models

SCSM does not compete with, replace, or revise empirical science.

---

### Metaphysics Beyond Structure
- Claims of ultimate truth
- Revelation, enlightenment, or privileged access
- Assertions of cosmic meaning or destiny

---

### Spiritual or Religious Doctrine
- Moral accounting systems
- Afterlife reward or punishment
- Salvation, judgment, or transcendence narratives
- Deities, guides, or intentional higher beings

Any overlap in language is incidental and constrained by definitions.

---

### Teleology and Purpose
- Goals, intentions, or optimization processes
- Evolution toward higher states
- Consciousness “learning lessons”
- Cosmic progress or development

The model is strictly non-teleological.

---

### Computational and AI Models
- Consciousness as computation or information processing
- Substrate as a simulator, computer, or mind
- Algorithmic identity models

---

## Interpretive Boundaries

SCSM should not be interpreted as:

- a worldview or belief system
- a substitute for scientific explanation
- an argument for or against materialism
- evidence for survival after death
- guidance for personal or ethical decision-making

It is a **framework for asking constrained questions**, not answering existential ones.

---

## What SCSM Claims — and Only This

SCSM claims only that:

- certain ontological assumptions can be made coherent together,
- certain phenomenological patterns constrain possible structures,
- and certain interpretations are internally consistent under stated constraints.

It does **not** claim that these assumptions are correct.

---

## Reader Responsibility

Readers are encouraged to:

- challenge assumptions directly,
- test internal consistency,
- propose alternative structures,
- and identify failure modes.

Readers are discouraged from:
- importing external doctrines,
- arguing from personal belief,
- or demanding empirical validation where none is claimed.

---

## Summary

SCSM is intentionally narrow.

Its strength lies not in explanatory reach, but in **discipline** —  
in clearly stating what it addresses, and refusing to claim what it does not.
