# Epistemic Stance
## Foundations of Interpretation and Evaluation

This document defines the **epistemic stance** governing the Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM).  
It specifies how claims should be interpreted, evaluated, and critiqued within this repository.

---

## Speculative Status

SCSM is **explicitly speculative**.

All statements within the model are to be read as:
- conceptual proposals,
- structural hypotheses,
- or constraint-based explorations,

and **not** as assertions of fact, truth, or empirical discovery.

Speculation here is disciplined: it is bounded by internal coherence, explicit constraints, and clearly stated non-claims.

---

## No Empirical Claims

SCSM does **not**:
- claim experimental verification,
- propose testable predictions,
- assert physical mechanisms,
- or reinterpret empirical data as proof.

References to observations (e.g., cosmology, phenomenology, neuroscience) are used **only to constrain plausibility**, not to validate ontology.

---

## Internal Coherence as Primary Criterion

The primary standard for evaluating SCSM is **internal coherence**.

A proposal is acceptable within the model if it:
- does not contradict stated axioms,
- respects declared constraints,
- remains consistent across sections,
- and does not introduce unstated assumptions.

Completeness is explicitly secondary to coherence.

---

## Constraint-Based Reasoning

SCSM uses **constraints** rather than causes or mechanisms.

Examples of constraints include:
- the persistence of identity reports across NDEs,
- the absence of time in certain phenomenological states,
- the validity of established physics within spacetime.

Constraints limit what the model can coherently claim, without determining what must be true.

---

## Domain Respect

Established domains of inquiry retain full authority within their scope:

- Physics governs spacetime phenomena.
- Neuroscience governs embodied brain processes.
- Biology governs organismal structure and function.

SCSM does not override, replace, or compete with these domains.  
It operates only at the level of **ontological interpretation**, outside empirical mechanism.

---

## Non-Teleology

No purpose, goal, optimization process, moral arc, or intention is attributed to:
- primordial consciousness,
- the substrate,
- identity,
- or the universe as a whole.

Any interpretation that introduces teleology is out of scope.

---

## Interpretive Discipline

Readers and contributors are expected to:
- separate phenomenological description from ontological inference,
- avoid importing spiritual, religious, or metaphysical doctrines,
- and critique structure rather than motivation or belief.

Agreement is not expected; disciplined disagreement is encouraged.

---

## Failure Acceptance

SCSM explicitly acknowledges the possibility of failure.

If:
- identity is shown to be fully emergent,
- memory is shown to be exhaustively localized and destructible,
- or consciousness is fully reduced without remainder,

then the model would require revision or abandonment.

This is a feature, not a flaw.

---

## Summary

SCSM should be approached as:

> a structured thought experiment operating under explicit epistemic constraints.

Its value lies in:
- clarity,
- coherence,
- and the questions it sharpens —

not in claims of truth.

All other documents in this repository are governed by this stance.
