## Scope, Intent, and Structural Commitments

---

## Purpose of This Document

This **MANIFEST** defines the **scope, intent, epistemic status, and structural guarantees** of the  
**Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)** repository.

It exists to:
- prevent misinterpretation of the work,
- establish what kinds of claims are in-scope and out-of-scope,
- guide future revisions and contributions,
- and preserve long-term conceptual coherence.

This document is normative for the repository.

---

## Epistemic Status

SCSM is **explicitly speculative**.

- It does **not** claim empirical validation.
- It does **not** claim scientific proof.
- It does **not** assert physical law beyond established domains.
- It does **not** attempt to compete with or replace physics, neuroscience, or biology.

All claims are to be interpreted as **ontological proposals under constraint**, not factual assertions.

---

## Scope

This repository is concerned with:

- Ontological structure of consciousness
- Identity persistence and individuation
- Memory as a non-local invariant
- Embodiment as a constraint regime
- Cosmology at the level of conceptual origin (not mechanism)
- Phenomenological patterns (e.g. NDEs) used as **constraints**, not evidence

The scope is **conceptual and structural**, not experimental.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope

The following are **not** within the scope of this project:

- Empirical experiments or claims of verification
- Predictive physical models
- Neuroscientific mechanism explanations
- Quantum-mechanical consciousness theories
- Spiritual, religious, or moral doctrines
- Teleological explanations (purpose, destiny, lessons)
- Claims of authority, revelation, or privileged knowledge

Any contribution that attempts to introduce these will be rejected.

---

## Structural Commitments

SCSM is built around the following commitments:

1. **Internal Coherence Over Completeness**  
   The model may remain incomplete if completeness would require unsupported assumptions.

2. **Constraint-Based Reasoning**  
   Observations and phenomenology constrain structure but do not validate ontology.

3. **Non-Teleology**  
   No purpose, optimization, or moral trajectory is assumed at any level.

4. **Domain Respect**  
   Established physics applies within spacetime and is not overridden.

5. **Failure Awareness**  
   Explicit failure modes are documented and preserved.

---

## Versioning Philosophy

- Versions represent **structural revisions**, not progress toward truth.
- Higher version numbers do **not** imply increased correctness.
- Backward incompatibilities must be explicitly noted.
- Deprecated ideas are archived rather than erased when possible.

---

## Contribution Principles

Acceptable contributions include:
- clarity improvements
- internal consistency checks
- identification of contradictions
- tightening of definitions
- refinement of constraints

Unacceptable contributions include:
- adding empirical claims
- reframing as science or spirituality
- introducing moral or teleological narratives
- overextending phenomenological interpretation

All contributions must respect this MANIFEST.

## Interpretive Caution

This work is **not an identity, belief system, or worldview**.

Readers are encouraged to:
- treat it as a structured thought experiment,
- disagree openly,
- test internal logic,
- and explore alternatives.

Agreement is not expected or required.

---

## Preservation and Stewardship

This repository is intended to:
- remain readable long-term,
- preserve conceptual history,
- and support responsible forking with attribution.

No claim is made that SCSM should be adopted, implemented, or believed.

---

## Final Statement

This repository asks a single constrained question:

> *If consciousness were ontologically fundamental, what minimal, internally coherent structure could account for identity, embodiment, and cosmology without violating known physical domains?*

Everything here exists in service of that question — and nothing more.
