# Acknowledgments

This repository represents an independent, speculative body of work developed
through sustained reflection, iteration, and structured analysis.

The author acknowledges the following forms of support and influence:

---

## Conceptual Influences

This work draws inspiration from long-standing discussions in:
- philosophy of mind,
- metaphysics,
- phenomenology,
- and foundational questions in physics.

No specific philosophical school or doctrine is adopted wholesale. Any overlap
with existing theories is the result of convergent inquiry rather than direct
derivation.

---

## AI Assistance

AI tools were used as **assistive instruments** during the development of this
repository, primarily for:
- drafting and refining language,
- restructuring and organizing documents,
- and improving clarity and internal consistency under explicit human guidance.

All substantive ideas, assumptions, and commitments remain the responsibility
of the human author(s). AI systems hold no authorship or epistemic authority
within this work.

Details of AI involvement are documented in the `05_ai/` directory.

## Review and Critique

Informal discussion, questioning, and critique — where they occurred — are
acknowledged as valuable for sharpening clarity, even when disagreement
remained.

No external reviewer is implied to endorse the contents of this repository.

---

## Responsibility Statement

Any errors, omissions, or inconsistencies in this work are the responsibility
of the author(s) alone.

## Closing Note

This project exists because careful speculative thinking still benefits from
structure, restraint, and transparency — even when certainty is unattainable.
