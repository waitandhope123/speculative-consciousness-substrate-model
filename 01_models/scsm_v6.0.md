# Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM v6.0)
## Canonical Model Document

This document presents the **complete, canonical formulation** of the  
**Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM v6.0)**.

All terms are defined in `GLOSSARY.md` and `00_foundations/definitions.md`.  
All interpretation is governed by `MANIFEST.md` and the epistemic stance documents.

## I. Core Axioms

### Axiom 1 — Substrate  
Primordial consciousness exists as a non-temporal, non-spatial substrate and is ontologically primary.

---

### Axiom 2 — State Change  
A single, non-recurring state change occurred within the substrate, producing spacetime, matter, energy,
and physical law.

---

### Axiom 3 — Coexistence  
The substrate persists concurrently with spacetime and is not consumed, transformed, or eliminated by
the state change.

---

### Axiom 4 — Constraint  
Physical laws govern spacetime only and do not apply to the substrate.

---

### Axiom 5 — Consciousness  
Individual consciousness is differentiated primordial consciousness, individuated through embodiment
constraints. Embodiment does not generate consciousness but individuates it.

---

### Axiom 6 — Identity  
Individual identities are persistent differentiations of primordial consciousness. Once individuated,
they remain bounded and do not revert to an undifferentiated primordial state.

---

### Axiom 7 — Memory  
Memory associated with an identity exists as invariant structure in the substrate, not subject to decay
or destruction. Access may be constrained during embodiment.

---

### Axiom 8 — Boundary  
A permeable boundary exists between embodiment and the substrate; permeability varies by identity history
and exposure.

---

### Axiom 9 — Non-Teleology  
The substrate has no intrinsic purpose, goal, optimization process, or trajectory.

---

### Identity Discreteness (Clarification)
Identity discreteness arises from the individuation process. Primordial consciousness, once differentiated
through embodiment, cannot fully revert to its undifferentiated state. The mechanism of individuation is
not specified, but its persistence is treated as irreversible.

---

## II. Derived Corollaries

### Physics Validity  
General Relativity and established physical laws remain valid within spacetime.

---

### Cosmology  
The substrate–spacetime state change occurs at the origin of spacetime (t = 0).  
The Cosmic Microwave Background, observable at approximately t ≈ 380,000 years, is the earliest
electromagnetic signature of that transition, corresponding to the moment spacetime became transparent
and its primordial thermal state could propagate freely. Its black-body spectrum is consistent with
emergence from a singular initial condition.

---

### Death  
Death terminates embodiment, not identity.

---

### Reincarnation  
Reincarnation is re-expression of an existing identity under new embodiment constraints, not transfer
or duplication.

---

### Forgetting  
Forgetting across lives is structural suppression, not loss.

---

### Individuation  
The state change that produced spacetime also established conditions for consciousness individuation.
Once individuated through embodiment, consciousness retains discrete identity structure and does not
dissolve back into primordial substrate.

---

### Dark Matter  
Dark matter represents the gravitational signature of substrate–spacetime coexistence. The substrate,
though non-spatial, influences spacetime curvature where the two domains interface. This produces
gravitational effects without electromagnetic interaction. This is a structural imprint, not a
consciousness-related phenomenon.

---

## III. Embodiment as a Constraint Regime

Embodiment:
- localizes awareness,
- enforces linear time,
- suppresses substrate memory access,
- and generates sensory urgency and affective compulsion.

Embodiment does not create identity or memory. It constrains their expression.

---

## IV. Boundary Properties

The boundary between embodiment and substrate is inherently permeable, gradual rather than absolute,
and never a true event horizon.

### Permeability
- structurally non-zero (no absolute seal)
- operates below phenomenological threshold under normal embodiment
- can be amplified by substrate exposure events (e.g., NDEs)
- once altered, remains elevated and is not reliably reversed by belief, training, or psychology
- threshold-crossing mechanisms remain unknown

---

### Cyclical Permeability and Sleep
Sleep represents a cyclical permeability regulation mechanism. During sleep, the boundary temporarily
increases permeability under reduced sensory constraint, allowing controlled substrate interaction.
Dream experience occurs universally during this state, but memory access upon waking is suppressed by
the same structural mechanisms that suppress cross-life memory.

---

### Somatic Boundary Detection
The embodiment–substrate boundary is directly detectable as a somatic field around conscious embodied
organisms. This field represents the interface volume where individuated consciousness couples to
spacetime constraints.

Key properties include elastic resistance, rate-dependent stability, autonomous expansion, and
consistent presence around conscious animals. The field vanishes upon rapid perturbation or embodiment
termination.

SCSM interprets this field as the boundary structure itself, not a permeability fluctuation.

---

## V. Identity Structure and Change

Identity remains distinct and persistent across death and reincarnation. Identity structure can be
reconfigured by substrate exposure, but change is bounded and non-destructive.

Identity without embodiment is best described as a stable pattern of selfhood without spatial
localization.

---

### Inter-Identity Dynamics
Individuated consciousnesses can interact in the substrate because they share a common ontological
ground. Interaction does not threaten discreteness because individuation creates persistent boundaries.
The nature of such interaction remains unspecified.

---

### Simultaneous Embodiment
A single identity may be coupled to multiple spacetime locations simultaneously. Because the substrate
is non-temporal, there is no contradiction in the same identity experiencing embodiment in different
historical periods “at once.” Sequential reincarnation is a subjective artifact of embodiment
constraints.

---

## VI. Memory

### Memory Existence  
Memory exists in the substrate as identity-associated invariant structure, independent of spatial or
temporal location.

### Memory Access  
Access to memory during embodiment is normally suppressed. Suppression is structural, not decay-based.

---

## VII. Phenomenology Handling Rule

Experiential reports are handled in three layers:
1. experiential report
2. recurring phenomenological structure
3. speculative ontological mapping

Phenomenology constrains the model but does not determine ontology.

---

## VIII. Near-Death Experience Constraints

Across cultures, NDEs show recurring structural features including loss of bodily localization,
altered time, identity persistence, cognitive clarity, transitional imagery, and reluctance to return.
These function as constraints, not confirmations.

---

## IX. Prolonged Clinical Death Cases

Some NDE reports occur in cases involving prolonged absence of ordinary signs of life with later
resuscitation. SCSM does not claim zero brain activity, but notes that reported experiential coherence
does not require continuous neural encoding.

---

## X. Null and Negative Cases

Absent or fragmented experiences are treated as cases of insufficient boundary uncoupling, unstable
coupling, or memory-access failure.

---

## XI. Asymmetries in Memory Access

Past-life recall occurs rarely; future recall does not. This asymmetry is treated as constraint-based,
not temporal.

---

## XII. Early-Life Consciousness

Infant awareness without autobiographical memory parallels post-reincarnation memory suppression and
reflects strong embodiment constraints early in life.

---

## XIII. Explicit Non-Claims

SCSM does not claim:
- the substrate is a mind, brain, or computer
- benevolence, justice, or moral structure
- progress, learning, or purpose
- identity merging or universal consciousness
- empirical verification
- that primordial consciousness has intentionality, goals, or awareness

---

## XIV. Failure Modes

SCSM would fail or require revision if:
1. identity is fully emergent with no remainder
2. memory is shown to vanish rather than become inaccessible
3. consciousness is fully reducible to computation
4. cosmology requires multiple ongoing state changes
5. NDE invariants collapse under scrutiny
6. prolonged-duration NDE coherence is fully explained without remainder

---

## XV. One-Line Summary

SCSM proposes primordial consciousness as a non-temporal substrate that produced spacetime at t = 0,
individuates into discrete persistent identities capable of simultaneous embodiment across spacetime
coordinates, maintains invariant memory, constrains individuated consciousness during embodiment via a
permeable boundary, and remains non-teleological and non-empirical by design.
