# Implications  
## Interpretive Consequences of the Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model

This directory explores the **implications** of the Speculative Consciousness
Substrate Model (SCSM) *if its axioms and internal logic are provisionally
accepted*.

These documents do **not** introduce new axioms, claims, or mechanisms.
They examine consequences that follow from the existing framework.

---

## Purpose of This Section

The goal of the implications section is to:
- clarify what the model would suggest in different domains,
- surface tensions or constraints implied by the model,
- and distinguish interpretive consequences from empirical claims.

These texts are **analytical and exploratory**, not predictive or evidentiary.

---

## How to Read These Files

Each file should be read as answering the question:

> “If SCSM were internally coherent, what would it imply in this domain?”

They should **not** be read as:
- assertions about physical reality,
- experimental predictions,
- or claims of validation.

Agreement with the implications does not imply agreement with the model itself.

## Files in This Directory

- **physical.md**  
  Examines implications for spacetime, cosmology, and matter *without*
  asserting testable predictions or physical mechanisms.

- **cognitive.md**  
  Explores consequences for consciousness, memory, identity, and embodiment
  under the model’s assumptions.

- **philosophical.md**  
  Addresses ontological, metaphysical, and conceptual implications, including
  limits, unresolved questions, and points of tension.

---

## Constraints

Implications presented here:
- remain bound by the model’s stated non-claims,
- do not invoke purpose, teleology, or moral structure,
- do not rely on spiritual or religious interpretations,
- and do not exceed the scope defined in `MANIFEST.md`.

---

## Reader Guidance

Readers are encouraged to:
- treat this section as a stress-test of coherence,
- identify where implications feel implausible or under-specified,
- and use those points to critique the model itself.

Disagreement here is expected and informative.

---

## Summary

This section exists to make the model’s consequences explicit,
not to persuade.

Clarity of implication is treated as a form of intellectual honesty.
