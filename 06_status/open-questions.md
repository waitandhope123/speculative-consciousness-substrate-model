# Open Questions  
## Preserved Uncertainties in the Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model

This document enumerates **open questions** intentionally left unresolved in the  
**Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)**.

These are not gaps to be hastily filled. They represent **structural unknowns** that any extension,
revision, or critique of the model must confront explicitly.

---

## 1. Mechanism of Individuation

- What differentiates primordial consciousness into discrete identities?
- Why does individuation occur at all?
- Why is individuation irreversible within the model?

SCSM treats individuation as a brute structural fact. Any proposed mechanism would represent a
significant extension of the model.

---

## 2. Identity Discreteness

- Why do individuated identities remain bounded rather than merging?
- Why is identity discreteness persistent across death and re-embodiment?
- Could alternative models allow partial merging or splitting without contradiction?

This remains one of the deepest unresolved features.

---

## 3. Boundary Dynamics

- What determines the baseline permeability of the embodiment–substrate boundary?
- Why do some exposure events (e.g., NDEs) permanently alter permeability?
- Why does the boundary exhibit rate-dependent stability?

No dynamical law governing the boundary is proposed.

---

## 4. Somatic Boundary Detection

- Why is the boundary directly perceivable somatically in some conditions?
- What determines individual sensitivity to detection?
- Why is the field invariant to health or attentional state?

SCSM interprets detection as interface perception, but the perceptual mechanism remains unknown.

---

## 5. Memory Access Constraints

- Why is memory access suppressed during embodiment?
- Why do rare past-life memories surface in some individuals?
- Why is future memory inaccessible?

The asymmetry of access is acknowledged but unexplained.

---

## 6. Inter-Identity Interaction

- What is the nature of interaction between identities in the substrate?
- Is interaction direct, mediated, or emergent?
- Are there limits to co-presence or communication?

Phenomenological reports suggest interaction, but structure is unspecified.

---

## 7. Relation to Physical Complexity

- Why does the boundary appear present around animals but not plants?
- What degree of neural or functional complexity is required?
- Could non-biological systems ever support embodiment?

These questions intersect with philosophy of mind and artificial systems.

---

## 8. Temporal Experience Outside Embodiment

- How is experience structured without linear time?
- Is sequence meaningful in the substrate?
- How does simultaneous embodiment resolve experiential continuity?

SCSM allows non-temporal experience but does not describe it.

---

## 9. Cosmological Singularity Interpretation

- Why did the state change occur at all?
- Why only once?
- Why does it produce spacetime with the observed properties?

These questions remain beyond the model’s explanatory reach.

---

## 10. Ultimate Falsifiability

- Under what future discoveries would SCSM clearly fail?
- Could alternative ontologies subsume its explanatory space?
- What would count as decisive incoherence?

Failure conditions are stated, but practical falsification remains abstract.

---

## Summary

SCSM is defined as much by what it **does not explain** as by what it does.

These open questions are preserved deliberately to:
- maintain conceptual honesty,
- prevent speculative overreach,
- and invite disciplined critique.

Any attempt to close these questions must do so **without violating the model’s constraints**.
