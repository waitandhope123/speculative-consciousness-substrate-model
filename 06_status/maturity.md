# Project Maturity  
## Current Status of the Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model

This document describes the **maturity level**, stability, and intended use of the  
**Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)** repository.

It is intended to set expectations for readers, contributors, and future maintainers.

---

## Maturity Level: Conceptual / Exploratory

SCSM is a **conceptual, exploratory model**.

It is:
- internally structured,
- versioned,
- explicitly constrained,
- and intentionally non-empirical.

It is **not**:
- experimentally validated,
- mathematically formalized,
- or intended for direct application.

The model should be understood as a **stable thought experiment**, not a work-in-progress toward proof.

---

## Stability of Core Structure

As of **v6.0**, the following aspects are considered **structurally stable**:

- Core axioms
- Non-teleological stance
- Embodiment as a constraint regime
- Identity persistence and individuation
- Memory as invariant substrate structure
- Boundary and permeability framework
- Interpretive handling of phenomenology

Future revisions are expected to refine language and clarity rather than alter foundations.

---

## Areas of Active Uncertainty

The following areas are explicitly **unresolved** and may change:

- Mechanism of individuation
- Nature of identity discreteness
- Detailed boundary dynamics
- Conditions influencing permeability thresholds
- Nature of inter-identity interaction in the substrate
- Relationship between substrate and specific physical structures

These uncertainties are preserved deliberately.

---

## Versioning Intent

Version numbers reflect **structural revisions**, not epistemic confidence.

- Minor versions: clarifications, reorganization, tightening
- Major versions: changes to axioms, commitments, or scope

Higher versions do **not** imply increased correctness.

---

## Contribution Readiness

The repository is open to:
- conceptual critique
- identification of contradictions
- clarity improvements
- alternative constrained formulations

It is not currently suited for:
- empirical testing
- formal proof attempts
- computational modeling

---

## Audience

SCSM is intended for readers familiar with:
- philosophy of mind
- metaphysics
- foundations of physics (conceptual level)
- phenomenology

It assumes comfort with abstraction and disciplined speculation.

---

## Longevity and Preservation

This repository is intended to:
- remain readable long-term,
- preserve conceptual history,
- support careful forking with attribution.

No claim is made that the model will converge to truth or consensus.

---

## Summary

SCSM is mature **as a conceptually complete speculative framework**,  
but intentionally incomplete **as an explanation of reality**.

Its value lies in structure, not certainty.
