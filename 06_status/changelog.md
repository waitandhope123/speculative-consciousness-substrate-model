# Changelog  
## Version History for the Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model

This changelog records **structural and conceptual changes** to the  
**Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)**.

Entries document *what changed* and *why*, not progress toward truth.

---

## v6.0 — Structural Consolidation and Boundary Formalization
**Status:** Current

### Major Changes
- Reframed **Axiom 1** to explicitly define *primordial consciousness* as ontologically primary.
- Clarified **individuation** as persistent and irreversible.
- Introduced **Simultaneous Embodiment** to resolve population dynamics without new axioms.
- Formalized **Somatic Boundary Detection** as direct perceptual interface, not permeability fluctuation.
- Integrated **sleep as cyclical boundary modulation**.
- Clarified **memory as invariant substrate structure**, not the substrate itself.
- Explicitly excluded intentionality, goals, or awareness from primordial consciousness.
- Tightened non-teleological stance across all sections.
- Consolidated phenomenology handling into constraint-based framework.

### Structural Improvements
- Unified axioms, corollaries, and implications under consistent terminology.
- Reduced ambiguity between phenomenological description and ontological commitment.
- Improved separation between speculative interpretation and physical domain respect.

## v5.8 — Identity and Memory Refinement
**Status:** Superseded

- Clarified identity persistence independent of embodiment.
- Added explicit treatment of memory invariance.
- Introduced identity discreteness as a required structural feature.
- Refined treatment of prolonged NDE coherence.

---

## v5.x — Iterative Development Phase
**Status:** Archived

- Progressive refinement of boundary concept.
- Initial incorporation of NDE phenomenology as constraint.
- Early exploration of dark matter as structural imprint.
- Development of non-teleological framework.

---

## Versioning Notes

- Version numbers indicate **structural revision**, not correctness.
- Deprecated ideas are preserved conceptually rather than erased.
- Future versions may refine language or reorganize structure without altering core commitments.

---

## Forward Compatibility

Future versions may:
- clarify unresolved boundary dynamics,
- refine individuation constraints,
- or reorganize documentation structure.

Any such changes will be documented here.

---

## Final Note

The changelog is a record of **conceptual evolution**, not discovery.
