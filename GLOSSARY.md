## Canonical Terms and Definitions for SCSM

This glossary defines how key terms are used **within the Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)**.  
Many terms overlap with philosophy, physics, or common usage, but **their meanings here may differ**.  
These definitions are authoritative for this repository.

---

## Consciousness
In SCSM, consciousness refers to **primordial consciousness** as an ontological substrate, and to **individuated consciousness** when constrained through embodiment. Consciousness is not generated by matter and is not defined as computation, information processing, or neural activity.

---

## Primordial Consciousness
The non-temporal, non-spatial ontological substrate proposed by SCSM. It is not a mind, agent, or entity with intentions or goals. It serves as the foundational ground from which spacetime and individuated consciousness arise.

---

## Substrate
The non-physical, non-spatiotemporal domain identified with primordial consciousness. The substrate is ontologically primary and persists concurrently with spacetime. Physical laws do not apply within it.

---

## State Change
A single, non-recurring transition within the substrate that produced spacetime, matter, energy, and physical law. This is not a process occurring in time, but the origin of time itself.

---

## Spacetime
The domain governed by physical laws, including General Relativity. Spacetime emerges from the substrate as a result of the state change and does not exhaust reality.

---

## Embodiment
The condition under which individuated consciousness is coupled to spacetime via a physical organism. Embodiment imposes constraints such as linear time, sensory localization, affective urgency, and memory suppression.

---

## Constraint
Any structural limitation imposed by embodiment that shapes experience, awareness, and memory access. Constraints do not create consciousness but modulate how it is expressed.

---

## Individuation
The differentiation of primordial consciousness into discrete, persistent identities. Individuation occurs under embodiment conditions and is treated as irreversible within the model.

---

## Identity
A bounded, persistent differentiation of primordial consciousness. Identity survives death, is not reducible to memory or personality, and does not merge back into an undifferentiated state.

---

## Identity Discreteness
The property that individuated identities remain distinct and bounded. In SCSM, this arises from the individuation process rather than being a fundamental constant.

---

## Memory
An invariant structure associated with an identity that exists in the substrate. Memory is not stored in spacetime and is not subject to decay or destruction, though access may be constrained during embodiment.

---

## Memory Suppression
The structural restriction that limits access to substrate memory during embodiment. Suppression explains forgetting, lack of past-life recall, and limited dream memory without invoking loss.

---

## Boundary
The interface between embodiment and the substrate. The boundary is permeable, dynamic, and rate-limited, allowing varying degrees of interaction between consciousness and spacetime.

---

## Boundary Permeability
The degree to which the boundary allows substrate interaction to influence embodied experience. Permeability is normally below phenomenological threshold but can increase during sleep, NDEs, or other boundary-modulating conditions.

---

## Somatic Boundary Field
The directly perceivable somatic field described in SCSM as the embodiment–substrate boundary itself. It exhibits elastic, rate-dependent behavior and is present around conscious animals during embodiment.

---

## Near-Death Experience (NDE)
A class of phenomenological reports occurring during extreme physiological states. In SCSM, NDEs function as **constraints on possible ontological structures**, not as evidence or proof.

---

## Phenomenology
First-person experiential reports. Phenomenology is treated as descriptive input that constrains models but does not determine ontology.

---

## Non-Teleology
The principle that no purpose, goal, optimization, moral direction, or intentional design is assumed at any level of the model.

---

## Simultaneous Embodiment
The proposal that a single identity may be coupled to multiple spacetime locations simultaneously, since the substrate is non-temporal. Sequential reincarnation is a subjective artifact of embodiment constraints.

---

## Dark Matter (SCSM Context)
Interpreted as a gravitational imprint of substrate–spacetime coexistence. This interpretation is structural and speculative, not a claim about particle physics.

---

## Failure Mode
A condition under which the SCSM framework would require revision or rejection due to contradiction, explanatory collapse, or full reduction by alternative theories.

---

## Speculative
Used in its strict sense: a proposal offered for conceptual exploration without claims of truth, proof, or empirical validation.

---

## Ontological
Pertaining to what is assumed to exist at the most fundamental level, independent of observation or measurement.

---

## Domain Respect
The principle that established scientific domains (e.g., physics, neuroscience) are not overridden or contradicted by SCSM outside their legitimate scope.

---

## Model
A structured conceptual framework intended to explore consistency and implications, not to assert factual correctness.

---

If a term appears ambiguous or overloaded, refer to this glossary before interpreting or critiquing its usage.
