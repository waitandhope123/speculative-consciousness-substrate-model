# Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)

## Overview

This repository contains the **Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)** — a structured, explicitly speculative ontological framework exploring the relationship between consciousness, identity, memory, embodiment, and cosmology.

SCSM proposes that **primordial consciousness** exists as a non-temporal, non-spatial substrate from which spacetime arises and within which individual identities are individuated and persist. The model emphasizes **internal coherence, conceptual constraints, and phenomenological consistency**, rather than empirical proof or physical formalism.

This work is not a theory of physics, nor does it claim experimental validation. It is a conceptual model intended for careful examination, critique, and refinement.

## What This Repository Is

- A **conceptual and ontological framework**
- A **speculative synthesis** of ideas from philosophy of mind, cosmology, and phenomenology
- A **versioned, internally constrained model** designed to be read as a whole
- A **non-teleological, non-empirical** exploration of consciousness and identity

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- ❌ A scientific or physical theory  
- ❌ A claim of empirical proof or experimental validation  
- ❌ A spiritual, religious, or moral doctrine  
- ❌ A computational or AI-based consciousness model  
- ❌ An attempt to explain consciousness via quantum mechanics or neuroscience  

All physical science referenced (e.g., General Relativity, cosmology) is treated as **valid within spacetime**, not extended beyond its domain.

## How to Read This Repository

If you are new to the project, the recommended reading order is:

1. **`MANIFEST.md`**  
   Formal declaration of scope, intent, epistemic stance, and structural guarantees.

2. **`00_foundations/`**  
   Definitions, assumptions, constraints, and non-claims that govern the model.

3. **`01_models/scsm_v6.0.md`**  
   The complete and canonical presentation of the Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model.

4. **`03_implications/`**  
   Explorations of philosophical, cognitive, and physical implications (clearly marked as interpretive).

5. **`06_status/`**  
   Project maturity, open questions, and version history.

A **Glossary (`GLOSSARY.md`)** is provided for precise usage of terms that may differ from standard meanings.

## Epistemic Status

SCSM is **explicitly speculative**.

- Claims are framed as **conceptual proposals**, not facts.
- Consistency is prioritized over completeness.
- Open questions are preserved rather than prematurely resolved.
- Failure modes are explicitly acknowledged.

Readers are encouraged to treat this work as a **thought experiment with structure**, not a belief system.

## Contributions and Feedback

This repository is open to:
- conceptual critique
- clarity improvements
- structural refinements
- identification of internal inconsistencies

Proposed contributions should respect the model’s **non-empirical, non-teleological** stance and its emphasis on internal coherence.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if present) or open an issue for discussion.

## Final Note

SCSM does not aim to answer *what is ultimately true*.  
It aims to ask:  

> *If consciousness were fundamental, what would a coherent universe built around that assumption look like?*

That question — and its constraints — are the purpose of this repository.
