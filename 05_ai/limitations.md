# AI Limitations  
## Constraints on AI Assistance in This Repository

This document clarifies the **limitations** of AI assistance used in the  
**Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)** repository.

It exists to prevent misinterpretation of AI involvement and to reinforce
human responsibility for all content.

---

## No Epistemic Authority

AI systems used in this project possess **no epistemic authority**.

They do not:
- determine what is true,
- validate arguments,
- resolve philosophical disputes,
- or assess empirical correctness.

All judgments about coherence, plausibility, and scope are human-made.

---

## No Autonomous Contribution

AI tools did not:
- originate the model,
- introduce axioms,
- decide structural commitments,
- or guide the project’s direction.

They responded only to **explicit human prompts** and constraints.

---

## Known Limitations of AI Assistance

AI-generated text may exhibit:
- surface-level coherence masking deeper issues,
- unintentional reinforcement of assumptions,
- over-smoothing of language that hides ambiguity,
- or subtle conceptual drift if not carefully reviewed.

These limitations are actively mitigated by human oversight.

---

## Non-Substitutability

AI assistance is **not a substitute** for:
- philosophical reasoning,
- conceptual rigor,
- or critical review.

Its role is supportive and editorial, not generative in an authoritative sense.

---

## Responsibility Statement

Any errors, ambiguities, or misinterpretations present in this repository
are the responsibility of the human author(s), not the AI tools used.

---

## Summary

AI assistance in SCSM is deliberately constrained.

It aids expression and organization while remaining **epistemically inert**.
