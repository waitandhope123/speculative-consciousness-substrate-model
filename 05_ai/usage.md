# AI Usage Disclosure  
## Role of AI Assistance in This Repository

This document describes the **limited and non-authoritative role** of AI assistance in the development
of the **Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)** repository.

Its purpose is transparency, not delegation of responsibility.

---

## Nature of AI Involvement

AI tools were used in this project **as assistive instruments**, comparable to advanced text editors or
structuring aids.

Their role included:
- reorganizing and refactoring human-provided text,
- improving clarity, consistency, and formatting,
- assisting with structural organization of documents,
- helping translate informal ideas into disciplined written form.

AI systems did **not** originate the core ideas, assumptions, axioms, or claims of the model.

---

## Scope of Assistance

AI assistance was limited to:
- drafting language under explicit human direction,
- suggesting organizational structures,
- identifying internal inconsistencies when prompted.

AI systems were **not** used to:
- generate claims autonomously,
- determine ontological commitments,
- evaluate truth or correctness,
- introduce empirical assertions,
- or adjudicate philosophical positions.

All conceptual decisions remain human-authored.

---

## Responsibility and Authorship

All responsibility for:
- the content,
- the assumptions,
- the interpretations,
- and any errors or omissions

rests entirely with the human author(s).

AI tools hold **no epistemic authority** within this repository.

---

## Limitations

AI-generated text may contain:
- subtle errors,
- unclear phrasing,
- or unintended implications.

All content has been curated and reviewed by a human, but readers are encouraged to
apply the same critical scrutiny as they would to any speculative theoretical work.

---

## Summary

AI tools were used as **assistants**, not authors.

They supported expression and organization, while **all substantive responsibility remains human**.
