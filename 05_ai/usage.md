## Specific Roles and Boundaries of AI Assistance

This document describes the **specific, limited roles** of AI systems used in
the development of the **Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)**.

It distinguishes between **human authorship**, **AI-assisted structuring**, and
editorial support, and assigns responsibility explicitly.

---

## Human Authorship (Primary)

The human author is solely responsible for:
- originating the core ideas, assumptions, and intuitions,
- determining all ontological commitments and constraints,
- accepting, rejecting, or modifying any suggested text,
- and curating the final structure and content of the model.

All claims, interpretations, and speculative commitments are human-authored.

## ChatGPT (Structural and Editorial Assistance)

ChatGPT was used as an **interactive assistant** to:
- help restructure informal ideas into coherent written form,
- suggest organization and document layout,
- assist in refining language for clarity and consistency,
- identify internal tensions or ambiguities when explicitly asked.

ChatGPT did **not**:
- originate the core theory,
- introduce axioms or commitments independently,
- decide what is true, plausible, or correct,
- or operate without continuous human direction.

Its role was collaborative and reactive, not autonomous.

## Claude (Secondary Review and Refinement)

Claude was used as a **secondary AI perspective** to:
- review structure and phrasing,
- suggest refinements for clarity or internal consistency,
- flag areas where assumptions could be tightened or made explicit,
- and propose limited wording changes under human oversight.

Claude did **not**:
- originate concepts or theory direction,
- adjudicate between competing interpretations,
- or exercise independent judgment over the model’s content.

All Claude-generated suggestions were subject to human acceptance or rejection.

## No Delegation of Authority

Neither AI system:
- holds epistemic authority,
- participates in authorship,
- or bears responsibility for the content.

AI tools functioned as **assistive instruments**, comparable to advanced
editorial or organizational aids.

---

## Responsibility Statement

Any errors, omissions, or inconsistencies in this repository are the
responsibility of the human author alone.

---

## Summary

This project is **human-authored, AI-assisted, and human-governed**.

AI tools supported expression and structure under explicit constraint, while
all substantive responsibility remains human.
