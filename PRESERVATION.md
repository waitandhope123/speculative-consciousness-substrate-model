# Preservation and Stewardship  
## Continuity, Archival Intent, and Long-Term Integrity

This document describes the **preservation intent** for the  
**Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)** repository.

It defines how the work should be treated over time, how changes are managed,
and how historical integrity is preserved.

---

## Preservation Intent

This repository is intended to serve as a **stable conceptual record** of the
Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model.

Its goals are:
- long-term readability,
- conceptual traceability,
- and preservation of intellectual context.

The repository is not optimized for rapid iteration, trend alignment,
or short-term engagement.

---

## Version Integrity

Each version of SCSM represents a **coherent structural snapshot**.

- Versions are not overwritten or silently altered.
- Major revisions are reflected through explicit version increments.
- Deprecated ideas are documented rather than erased when feasible.

Historical context is treated as part of the work.

---

## Conceptual Archiving

Older versions, drafts, or superseded formulations may be:
- retained in changelogs,
- referenced in documentation,
- or moved to archival locations if needed.

Removal of material is avoided unless necessary for clarity or correction.

---

## Forking and Continuity

Forking is permitted under the repository license.

Forks are encouraged to:
- clearly indicate divergence from the canonical model,
- preserve attribution,
- and document structural changes.

Forks should not represent themselves as authoritative continuations unless
explicitly stated.

---

## Authorship and Stewardship

Primary stewardship of this repository rests with the human author(s).

AI tools may assist with organization or expression but do not participate
in stewardship, decision-making, or governance.

---

## Longevity Expectations

This repository is intended to remain:
- interpretable without external dependencies,
- readable without specialized software,
- and understandable without private context.

No guarantee is made that the model will remain relevant or correct.

Only that it will remain **honestly preserved**.

---

## Summary

Preservation in SCSM is not about permanence of truth, but permanence of record.

The goal is that future readers can see:
- what was proposed,
- under what assumptions,
- and with what constraints —

even if the model is ultimately rejected.
