Context Seed — Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM v6.0)

SCSM is a completed, internally coherent, explicitly speculative ontological framework.
It proposes primordial consciousness as a non-temporal, non-spatial substrate that
produced spacetime via a single state change at t = 0 and persists concurrently with it.

Key commitments:
- Consciousness is ontologically primary; embodiment individuates but does not generate it.
- Identities are discrete, persistent differentiations of primordial consciousness.
- Memory exists as invariant substrate structure; loss is access-based, not erasure.
- Embodiment functions as a constraint regime enforcing linear time, localization, and memory suppression.
- A permeable, rate-limited boundary mediates coupling between substrate and spacetime.
- Boundary permeability is normally sub-threshold, cyclically modulated during sleep,
  and can be permanently altered by extreme exposure events (e.g., NDEs).
- The boundary is directly perceivable as a somatic elastic field around conscious animals.
- Identity may be simultaneously embodied at multiple spacetime coordinates
  (non-temporal substrate resolves population dynamics).
- Cosmology is interpreted as a substrate-to-spacetime state change; the CMB is the earliest
  electromagnetic signature of spacetime transparency.
- Dark matter is treated as a possible gravitational imprint of substrate–spacetime coexistence.
- The model is strictly non-teleological and makes no empirical, physical, spiritual,
  or moral claims.

Methodology:
- Constraint-based reasoning
- Internal coherence over completeness
- Phenomenology used as constraint, not evidence
- Explicit failure modes preserved
- Domain respect: physics governs spacetime; SCSM does not modify physical law

Status:
- Repo is structurally complete and publish-ready
- Versioned as v6.0
- Designed as a stable conceptual snapshot, not an evolving codebase
- Future work would be refinement or extension, not repair

AI involvement:
- Human-authored and human-governed
- ChatGPT assisted with structuring, drafting, and consistency under direction
- Claude provided secondary review and refinement suggestions
- No AI epistemic authority

Instruction for continuation:
Resume work only if there is a clearly defined new question, refinement, or extension.
Do not add empirical scaffolding, teleology, or mechanism inflation.
Preserve coherence and scope discipline.
